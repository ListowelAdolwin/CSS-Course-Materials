						PARITY
						
Parity is an error detection mechanism in computing. 
Unlike other mechanisms(e.g Hamming code), parity is able to correct the  errors
One bit in a character is the parity bit.
We have even and odd parities. 
The parity bit is at the least significant(The rightmost) bit of the character
The number of 1s(ons) tells whether the parity is odd or even.
When the number of 1s is even, the parity bit is represented by 0 and that is an even parity
